# Cryptocurrencies


**Overview**

Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Unsupervised machine learning was used to analyze the database crypto currencies. 

**Results**

Uncertain of output for this analysis regarding unsupervised machine learning, to help us identify how many clusters of crypto currencies. The use of K-Means method to produce our Elbow Curve. The k values were from 1 to 10. The diagram below indicates that an output of four clusters to categorize the crypto currencies.

To assist in visualization of our clusters is a 2D Scatter Plot and 3D Scatter Plot.
